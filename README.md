## 📌 Task Objective

The objective of this task was to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships between various variables that might have influenced passenger survival.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **File Used:** `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

---

## 🧪 Key Explorations & Insights

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately (e.g., `Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`)
  - Converted categorical variables into numerical form where needed

- **EDA Highlights:**  
  - Distribution of survival based on `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Age`
  - Heatmap of correlations between numerical features
  - Count plots for various categorical attributes
  - Age distribution between survivors and non-survivors

---

## 🔍 Visualizations Included

- Survival counts by gender and class
- Age distribution plots
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Box plots to compare features with survival outcomes

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Google Colab**
